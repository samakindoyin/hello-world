# hello-world
This is my first attempt at Git-Hub and I am not so sure what I am doing yet.
I have just started this course on Data Scientist's Toolbox under the Coursera program
And we are required to go through this process. Heavens know why but I am determined to give the project a good go so here I go
I may make some mess but as long as I learn something in the end, I think it will be worth the effort.
